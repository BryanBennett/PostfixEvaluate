/* Main Description: This program uses exprs.txt as an input, which contains postfix arithmetic expressions.
It reads in all operators and operands and creates an "expression" object using the expression class.
This object stores each individual expression and then evaluates it using a stack.
The loop in this main navigates each expression and individually evaluates them, printing the results with each iteration.
